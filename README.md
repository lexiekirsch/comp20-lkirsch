COMP 20 Fall 2016 Private Repo for Lexie Kirsch

This Git repository contains my files for the following labs and assignments from Comp20: 
responsive lab, mbta assignment, movie_annotation lab, captainslog lab, 2048-changes assignment, and security assignment.

My favorite assignment was assignment 1, making my portfolio, because I had no idea what I was doing, or what I could do, so I just played around. 
I made the background yellow and had green buttons and tables with blue text that turned pink when you hovered over them. It was fun to make and now it's fun to use.
My favorite lab was the responsive lab, because it felt the most interactive. 
I remember running around my dorm, showing my friends how Homer retreated into the bushes as I manipulated the size of the window. 
They were not impressed, but I was too excited to care.

I think the reason that my favorite assignment and lab are from early on in the course is because I've come such a long way since then.
It's fun to look back on times when I was excited that I could do things like change colors and add images, because that used to be so impressive,
and now I'm making a game, which is way cooler! And I'm using some of the same stuff - sprites, colors, buttons - but in a different way.

I think the most important thing I've learned in this course is that the resources I need are out there; I just need to find them and be comfortable using them.
It took me way too long to realize that W3Schools is loaded with useful information, Ming's examples hold all the answers, and TAs are there to help. 
I used to try not to go to TAs because I didn't want to feel like my success was dependent upon someone else, but they wouldn't be there to help if no one needed the help.

Now that the course is over, it's time to delve deeper into the topics that the course didn't cover... e.g. phaser physics.
