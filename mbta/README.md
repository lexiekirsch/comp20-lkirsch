1. I have implemented a web page that shows all the MBTA Red Line subway train stations on a map and each station's real-time schedule of upcoming trains.
2. I had help on this assignment from TAs Yotam Bentov and John Gallagher (Shoutout to John for being patient when my computer was being "slow as molasses"). Also, I modified the Haversine formula from Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript).
3. This assignment took approximately 12 hours.
