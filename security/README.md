1. Implemented 3 "hacks" on user's web application.
2. Asked a TA and another student for advice, but it didn't help. What did help was a message from Ming and seeing how my partner hacked my own application.
3. Spent about 2 hours trying to figure out why my script tags weren't working (/script should be \/script), another 2 hours actually hacking the application, and another hour to write the report. I know, I know, I work slowly, but I had fun with it.
